 * you dont have to first establish the connection like you do with TCP (previous examples are all TCP)
 * You still need a socket though (and end point to send the data to. But it is not connection oriented)
 * Data is sent with a DATAGRAM PACKET.
 * think of TCP as like using a telephone, where a connection has to be established before data can be sent.
 * Think of UDP as like sending an envelope through the mail
